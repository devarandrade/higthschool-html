    High school is the education students receive from approximately 12 to 17
years old. Most comparable to secondary schools, high schools generally deliver
phase three of the ISCED model of education. High schools have subject-based
classes.
The name high school is applied in other countries,
but no universal generalization can be made as to the age range,
financial status, or ability level of the pupils accepted.
 In North America, most high schools include grades nine through twelve.
    History

The first taxpayer-funded public school in the United States was in Dedham.
The first institution labeled as a "high school" was Edinburgh's Royal High School
in Scotland, which was founded in 1505. The Royal High School was used as a model 
for the first public high school in the United States, Boston Latin School,
 founded in Boston, Massachusetts in 1635.[2][3][4] 
 Boston Latin School was initially a private school,
 so although it did become the first public high school,
 a school system in Dedham, Massachusetts was the first to be supported
 by public taxation.[5] The schools prepared boys for the law or the church.
 The length of the school day varied with the seasons, but there was a shortage
 of Latin speakers available to become teachers because the job was unattractive
  due to low status and low pay. The colony ordered in the English Protestant Tutor, retitled as The New England Primer, to be used as a textbook, and the tuition was written by and had a Calvinist tone.[6] This was the start of a secondary education system.

In 1642, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was able to pass a law to require parents to make sure that their children were able to read, which required some form of elementary education. In 1647, Massachusetts again passed a law that required communities to establish some type of public schooling system. Elementary schools were to be formed in every town with 50 or more families, and every town with at least 100 families would have to provide a Latin Grammar School.[7][8]

Over a century later in 1779, Thomas Jefferson proposed the opening of new secondary schools to provide segregated secondary schools with different tracks in his words for "the laboring and the learned." The new academies would be practical in nature but allow a few of the working class to advance by "raking a few geniuses from the rubbish."[citation needed]

In 1785, before the U.S. Constitution was ratified, the Continental Congress passed a law calling for a survey of the Northwest Territory, which included what was to become the state of Ohio. The law created townships, reserving a portion of each township for a local school.[8] Under the constitution, education was relegated to individual states.

The Pennsylvania state constitution, written in 1790, calls for free public education, but only for poor children, assuming that the rich will pay for their own children's schooling.[8] In 1805, the New York Public School Society was formed by the wealthy to provide education to the poor. These schools were run on the Lancasterian system, in which one "master" taught hundreds of students in a single room. The masters would give rote lessons to the older students, who would then pass it down to the younger students. Society was moving from an agrarian model with small independent plots to an industrial one, where workers needed to be literate and numerate. Lancastrian schools emphasized discipline and obedience: qualities that factory owners needed in their workers.[8]

An 1817 Boston Town Meeting petitioned for the establishment of a system of free public primary schools. The main support came from local merchants, businessmen, and wealthier artisans, while many wage earners opposed it because they knew they would be paying for it through income taxation. In spite of this, Boston Latin School became public in 1820. This was the first public high school in the United States. Seven years later, a state law in Massachusetts made all grades of public school open to all pupils, free of charge.[8]

However, in the slave-owning states, things were different. Even after public schools were being opened up to all ages in Massachusetts, in the 1830s, it was illegal in southern states to teach black children to read. High schools were out of the question.[8] After many years of advocacy, in 1957, federal court ordered the integration of Little Rock, Arkansas public schools. The governor sent in troops to physically prevent nine African American students from enrolling at all-white Central High School. Though, this decision was overturned by the president. The same delay in equality in public high schools can be accounted for the general regarding of other groups as minorities in the US.[8]
